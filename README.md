# Quantifying superposition in Neural Networks
_Alexandre Duplessis_

Following the work  of Nelson Elhage et al. ([Toy Models of Superposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10652) ), this works aims at quantifying superposition in neural networks by analyzing the dependancy of this phenomenon on variables such as sparsity of data, or learning space dimension.
